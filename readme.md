Okay, here is the structure of the project, based on the files and code we've been working with:

Use code with caution.

Explanation:

src/main/java/com/example/dataanalysis: This is the core of your Java code, organized by package:

controller/DataController.java: This class defines your REST API endpoints. It handles incoming HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and interacts with the DataService to process them.

model/DataEntity.java: This class represents the structure of your data. It's annotated with JPA @Entity to map it to a database table.

repository/DataRepository.java: This interface extends Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository. It provides basic database operations (CRUD) and allows you to define custom queries.

service/DataService.java: This class contains your business logic. It interacts with the DataRepository to perform database operations and enforces any business rules (like data validation).

DataAnalysisManagementSystemApplication.java: This is your main Spring Boot application class. It contains the main method to start the application.

src/main/resources/application.properties: This file contains configuration settings for your application, including database connection details, JPA settings, and more.

src/test/java: This directory is where you would put your unit tests and integration tests. You haven't written any tests yet, but it's a standard part of a Maven project.

target/: This directory is generated by Maven when you build your project. It contains compiled classes, packaged JAR files, and other build artifacts.

pom.xml: This is your Maven project's configuration file. It defines project dependencies (like Spring Boot, PostgreSQL driver, Spark), build settings, and more.

large_government_data.csv: This is your sample CSV data file that you'll use for testing and demonstrating data ingestion (eventually).

In essence, your project follows a typical layered architecture:

Presentation Layer: DataController (handles user interaction through the REST API).

Service Layer: DataService (contains business logic).

Data Access Layer: DataRepository (interacts with the database).

This structure, along with the use of Spring Boot and JPA, makes your project well-organized, maintainable, and scalable. It also demonstrates a good understanding of common Java development practices.
